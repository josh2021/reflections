When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When your computer is not your own or when it is breaking down or something. Just to be safe, keep it in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because some changes you might not want to include from public repository.
