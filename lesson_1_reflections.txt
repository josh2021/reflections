What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

A: Manually is pretty bad because you can forget. A smart autosave feature would be ideal.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: Because Google Docs isn't used for coding while Git is used for coding where more than one file is interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
